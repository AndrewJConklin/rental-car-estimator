# Java Rental Car Estimator

In `App.java`, write an app that estimates the cost of reserving a rental car. Prompt the user for the following information:

* Pickup date (store as a string)
* Number of days for the rental
* Whether they want an electronic toll tag at $3.95/day (yes/no)
* Whether they want a GPS at $2.95/day (yes/no)
* Whether they want roadside assistance at $3.95/day (yes/no)
* Their current age

Calculate and display:

* Basic car rental
* Options cost
* Underage driver surcharge
* Total cost

The basic car rental is $29.99 per day. There is a 30% surcharge on the basic car rental for drivers under 25. All taxes have already been incorporated into the fees shown.
